# Download and Extract File from Google Drive Kubeflow Operation
This Kubeflow OP downloads a file from google drive and extracts it, passing the extracted folder as its output.

The file must be publicly shared and have its ID extracted, i.e. in the example below:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nncjPluvgGprJra6tbJRobZy0g1Moj0i/view?usp=sharing

The file ID will be `1nncjPluvgGprJra6tbJRobZy0g1Moj0i`.

This component is based on this [repo](https://github.com/nsadawi/Download-Large-File-From-Google-Drive-Using-Python).
